Go template
===========

This is a starting point for a new Go project.

It provides:

  * a working [Travis CI configuration](.travis.yml)
  * a working [CircleCI configuration](circle.yml)
  * a minimal [Hound configuration](.hound.yml)
  * a [`bin/setup`](bin/setup) script compatible with godep
  * a [`bin/vet`](bin/vet) script for running in CI
    or as a pre-commit hook.
  * a [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) based on
    [thoughtbot/templates](https://github.com/thoughtbot/templates)
    with accurate instructions for Go development.
